# Architecture

This document describes the architecture of prosecheck, an LLM-powered code linter with natural-language rules. Sections marked **[PLANNED]** are designed but not yet implemented. Sections marked **[STUB]** have file structure in place but no implementation code.

## About `docs/architecture/`

The `docs/architecture/` folder holds architecture documentation for each system. This file (`ARCHITECTURE.md`) is the high-level overview of the whole project. A smaller project may only need this single file; as systems grow more complex, they can be broken out into dedicated files in this directory (e.g., `execution-pipeline.md`, `config-system.md`).

## Entry Points

### `src/cli.ts` — CLI Binary [IMPLEMENTED]

Commander-based argument parsing. Registers `lint`, `init`, and `config` subcommands with full flag support. Resolves environment (`--env`) and operating mode (`--mode`) as orthogonal concerns. Sets `process.exitCode` (never `process.exit()`) for graceful cleanup. Boolean flags use `<bool>` syntax (e.g., `--warn-as-error=1` / `--warn-as-error=0`).

**Exit codes:** 0 = all passed, 1 = rule failures, 2 = tool/config error.

### `src/index.ts` — Library API [IMPLEMENTED]

Programmatic entry point for use as a library dependency. Exports: core types (`Config`, `RuleResult`, `Rule`, `RuleStatus`, `RunContext`, `PromptVariables`), engine (`runEngine`, `EngineResult`), config loading (`loadConfig`, `resolveEnvironment`, `ConfigError`), result types (`CollectResultsOutput`, `RuleResultWithId`, `DroppedRule`), all three formatters (`formatStylish`, `formatJson`, `formatSarif`), and commands (`init`, `lint`).

---

## Commands

### `src/commands/lint.ts` — Lint Command [IMPLEMENTED]

Parses lint-specific CLI flags (env, mode, format, ref, warnAsError, retryDropped, lastRunRead/Write, timeout, claudeToRuleShape, maxConcurrentAgents, maxTurns, allowedTools, output, hashCheck, hashCheckWrite, rules, debug), builds CLI overrides, loads config via `loadConfig()`, constructs `RunContext`, invokes `runEngine()`, writes output to stdout, and sets `process.exitCode` (0 for pass/warn, 1 for fail/dropped, 2 for config/unexpected errors). When stdout is a TTY and format is `stylish`, lazy-imports the Ink UI (`src/ui/render.ts`) for interactive progress display instead of plain text output. Supports `--output <file>` to write results to a file (in addition to stdout) for environments where stdout capture is unreliable. `--hash-check` runs in lightweight mode (no agents, no API key) comparing content hashes only. `--hash-check-write` updates stored hashes without running agents. `--debug` streams per-agent stdout/stderr to `.prosecheck/working/logs/<rule-id>.log` for troubleshooting dropped or misbehaving agents. Key function: `lint(options: LintOptions)`.

### `src/commands/init.ts` — Init Command [IMPLEMENTED]

Scaffolds `.prosecheck/` directory with default `config.json` (baseBranch, globalIgnore, ruleCalculators defaults), creates `working/` subdirectory, adds entries to `.gitignore` (working/, output.*, config.local.json) with a `# prosecheck` header, and optionally creates a starter `RULES.md` with example rules. Supports integration scaffolding flags: `--github-actions`, `--github-actions-incremental`, `--github-actions-hash-check`, `--git-pre-push`, `--claude-stop-hook`, and `--sarif`. Integration flags are idempotent — re-running overwrites existing generated files. Key function: `init(options: InitOptions)`.

### `src/templates/workflows.ts` — GitHub Actions Workflow Templates [IMPLEMENTED]

Builders for GitHub Actions workflow YAML files used by `init`. Each builder takes a `sarif` flag to optionally add SARIF output and Code Scanning upload steps. Templates: `buildFullWorkflow` (full lint on PR), `buildIncrementalPrWorkflow` (incremental with last-run), `buildMergeQueueWorkflow` (merge queue trigger), `WORKFLOW_HASH_CHECK` (lightweight hash-check, no API key).

### `src/commands/config.ts` — Config List & Set Command [IMPLEMENTED]

Non-interactive CLI for viewing and modifying `.prosecheck/config.json`. Two subcommands:

- **`config list`** — Loads current config via `loadConfig()`, extracts all fields by walking the Zod `ConfigSchema` shape (recursing into nested objects like `lastRun` and `claudeCode`), and displays each field's dot-path, current value, default/modified marker, and description (from `.describe()`). Schema-driven — new config fields automatically appear.
- **`config set <key>=<value> [...]`** — Parses dot-path keys, coerces string values to correct types (boolean, number, string, string[], JSON objects) based on schema introspection, validates against `ConfigSchema`, and writes minimal diff to `config.json` (only non-default values are persisted). Cleans up empty parent objects.

Key exported functions: `config()`, `extractFields()`, `resolveSchemaType()`, `coerceValue()`.

---

## Core Library (`src/lib/`)

### `config-schema.ts` — Zod Config Schema [IMPLEMENTED]

Single source of truth for configuration shape, types, defaults, and documentation. Defines:

- **`ConfigSchema`** — full Zod schema with `.describe()` on every field and `.default()` for all defaults. Sub-schemas (`LastRunSchema`, `ClaudeCodeSchema`, `CalculatorConfigSchema`, `EnvironmentOverrideSchema`) compose into the top-level schema.
- **`PartialConfig` type** — TypeScript mapped type for overlay layers (Zod v4 has no `.deepPartial()`).
- **`Config` type** — `z.infer<typeof ConfigSchema>`, the TypeScript type used throughout the codebase. No separate type definition.
- **`RuleResultSchema`** — discriminated union (`pass | warn | fail`) for agent output JSON validation.

The schema serves four roles: TypeScript type inference, runtime validation with actionable error messages, default value declaration, and runtime introspection for the config editor command. `ClaudeCodeSchema` includes model-related fields: `defaultModel` (default `'sonnet'`), `teamsOrchestratorModel` (optional, for the orchestrator in one-to-many-teams mode), and `validModels` (accepted model names for per-rule frontmatter validation).

### `config.ts` — Configuration Loading [IMPLEMENTED]

Loads and layers configuration with four-level precedence:

1. `.prosecheck/config.json` — base defaults (committed)
2. `.prosecheck/config.local.json` — personal overrides (gitignored)
3. Environment overrides — named block from `config.environments[env]`
4. CLI flags — highest priority

Deep merge at each layer (arrays replaced, not concatenated). Base config validated with `ConfigSchema.safeParse()`, local config deep-merged without separate schema validation, final merged result validated with `ConfigSchema`. Invalid config throws `ConfigError` with Zod's structured error paths.

Environment is resolved from `--env` flag, `process.env.CI` auto-detection, or `interactive` default.

Key config fields: `baseBranch`, `globalIgnore`, `additionalIgnore`, `lastRun`, `timeout`, `warnAsError`, `retryDropped`, `retryDroppedMaxAttempts`, `claudeCode`, `postRun`, `environments`, `ruleCalculators`.

### `engine.ts` — Orchestrator [IMPLEMENTED]

Central coordinator that drives the lint pipeline:

1. Cleanup `.prosecheck/working/`
2. Run rule calculators → collect all rules (early return if none)
2-filter. If `--rules` is set, filter to matching rules by name (case-insensitive) or ID, warning if nothing matches. Partial runs still write cache entries — only the targeted rules' entries are updated, other rules' entries are preserved
2a. Resolve per-rule models — validate each rule's `model` against `validModels` (warning on unknown values), then stamp `defaultModel` onto rules without an explicit model
2b. If `--hash-check` is set, run hash-check mode (compare content hashes, pass/fail without agents) and return early
2c. If `--hash-check-write` is set, compute and write current hashes without running agents and return early
3. Run change detection → get triggered rules (early return if none)
4. Fire `discovered` and `running` progress events (if `onProgress` callback set)
5. Generate per-rule prompts
6. Start output file watcher (if `onProgress` set) — lazy-imports `output-watcher.ts`
6a. Start `TimingTracker` to record per-rule start/completion times
7. Dispatch to operating mode (`claude-code` or `user-prompt`)
8. Stop output watcher and timing tracker
9. Collect results (with dropped detection), attaching timing data
10. Retry dropped rules if `retryDropped` enabled — re-generate prompts, re-dispatch, re-collect, up to `retryDroppedMaxAttempts` rounds. Stops early when all dropped rules resolve.
11. Apply `warnAsError` promotion
12. Format output (stylish/json/sarif)
13. Execute post-run tasks
14. Persist per-rule cache entries for passing triggered rules (if `lastRun.write` enabled)

Key function: `runEngine(context: RunContext): Promise<EngineResult>`. Returns formatted output string, overall status, and raw results. Accepts optional `onProgress` callback on `RunContext` for real-time progress tracking.

### `change-detection.ts` — Per-Rule Cache & Rule Triggering [IMPLEMENTED]

Determines which rules trigger this run and which are cached. Implements the per-rule cache model from ADR-014.

**When `lastRun.read` is enabled (per-rule cache path):** For each rule, compute the rule's fingerprint (via `fingerprint.ts`) and the SHA-256 content hashes of every file in its scope. Compare both to the stored `CachedRuleEntry` in `.prosecheck/last-user-run`. A rule is cached (skipped) only if its fingerprint matches AND every in-scope file hash matches. Otherwise it triggers. Changed-files reported to the agent are the per-rule file diff (or the full scoped file list when the fingerprint changed).

**When `lastRun.read` is disabled (legacy narrowing path):** `git diff --name-only <comparisonRef>` plus untracked files; rules trigger if any in-scope file is in that set.

The comparison ref comes from the CLI `--ref` flag or falls back to `git merge-base HEAD <baseBranch>` (branch name if merge-base fails on shallow clones).

Returns `ChangeDetectionResult` with: `comparisonRef`, `triggeredRules`, `cachedRules`, `changedFiles`, `changedFilesByRule` map, and optional `writeRuleCacheEntries(passingRuleIds)` callback (present when `lastRun.write` is enabled). The writer preserves entries for un-triggered rules, writes entries for triggered rules that passed, and drops entries for triggered rules that did not pass. Only `status: 'pass'` entries are ever stored.

Default last-run behavior: `read` and `write` are both off. Users opt in via environment overrides or CLI flags (e.g., `--last-run-write 1` for local development, `--last-run-read 1` in CI).

### `fingerprint.ts` — Rule Fingerprinting [IMPLEMENTED]

Computes a stable SHA-256 fingerprint covering every non-file-content input that could change a rule's verdict: the rule's description text, inclusions, model, frontmatter bag, the prompt template, and the global system prompt. A fingerprint mismatch invalidates any cached entry for the rule, forcing re-evaluation on the next run. Key function: `computeRuleFingerprint(rule, { promptTemplate, globalPrompt })`.

### `content-hash.ts` — Content Hashing [IMPLEMENTED]

Computes SHA-256 content hashes for files with cross-platform consistency. Normalizes `\r\n` to `\n` before hashing. `computeFilesHash()` produces a per-file hash map and a single digest (hash of sorted `path:hash` pairs). Used by the per-rule cache in `change-detection.ts` and by `--hash-check` mode.

**Hash-check mode** (`--hash-check`): Lightweight lint mode that checks the per-rule cache without launching agents or requiring an API key. A rule passes if its cache entry is current (fingerprint matches and all in-scope file hashes match). Any rule whose cache entry is stale or missing fails with the list of changed files. Exits without mutating cache state.

**Hash-check-write mode** (`--hash-check-write`): Recomputes current file hashes and fingerprints and writes cache entries for every rule without running agents. Lets users manually mark the current state as checked when they know changes are irrelevant.

### `ignore.ts` — Pattern Matching [IMPLEMENTED]

Uses the `ignore` npm package for gitignore-format pattern matching. `buildIgnoreFilter()` combines `globalIgnore` inline patterns with patterns from `additionalIgnore` files (defaults to `.gitignore`). `buildInclusionFilter()` creates per-rule scope predicates. `filterFiles()` applies both filters. Applied globally before per-rule inclusions.

### `rule.ts` — Rule Types [IMPLEMENTED]

Type definitions and factory functions for rules. Each rule has: name, description (natural language), inclusions (gitignore patterns), source reference (originating file), a stable filesystem-safe ID slug generated by `makeRuleId()`, optional `group` (for rule grouping under one agent), optional `model` (which Claude model evaluates the rule), and optional `frontmatter` bag (`Record<string, unknown>` for unrecognized frontmatter fields preserved for future use).

### `frontmatter.ts` — Frontmatter Parser [IMPLEMENTED]

Extracts YAML frontmatter from markdown files. Returns parsed data object + remaining body. Handles missing frontmatter gracefully (returns empty data, full body). Invalid YAML is treated as no frontmatter (a warning is logged to stderr). `extractGroupFromFrontmatter()` separates the `group` field from the rest, returning unknown fields as a passthrough bag. `extractRuleMetadata()` is the primary API used by calculators: given a rule's description lines, it skips leading blanks, parses any inline `---` YAML block, and returns `{ group, model, frontmatter, description }`.

### `execution-plan.ts` — Execution Plan Builder [IMPLEMENTED]

Builds the `[sequential batches [parallel invocations [rules]]]` execution hierarchy for claude-code mode. Each `Invocation` has a `type`, `rules`, and optional `model` (which Claude model to use for the process). Three invocation types: `one-to-one` (one process per rule), `one-to-many-teams` (parallel sub-agents), `one-to-many-single` (sequential in one agent). `buildExecutionPlan()` separates rules into ungrouped (dispatched per `claudeToRuleShape`) and grouped. For `one-to-many-single` and groups, rules are partitioned by model via `partitionByModel()` — each model partition becomes a separate invocation. For `one-to-many-teams`, mixed models are fine (handled via orchestration prompt annotations); the invocation uses `teamsOrchestratorModel`. Invocations are packed into batches respecting `maxConcurrentAgents`. Teams can be split across batches; other types use no-split insertion.

### `prompt.ts` — Prompt Generation [IMPLEMENTED]

Generates per-rule prompt files at `.prosecheck/working/prompts/<rule-id>.md`. Each prompt includes:

- Rule text (full natural-language description)
- Comparison ref (git ref to diff against)
- Changed files list (modifications, additions, deletions)
- Scope (inclusion patterns)
- Output path (`.prosecheck/working/outputs/<rule-id>.json`)
- General guidance (evaluate full codebase within scope, output JSON only)
- Output schema examples (pass/warn/fail JSON shapes)

Template is configurable via `.prosecheck/prompt-template.md` (falls back to built-in default). Global system prompt from `.prosecheck/prompt.md` is prepended when present. Interpolation uses `{{variable}}` placeholders. Key functions: `loadTemplate()`, `loadGlobalPrompt()`, `buildPromptVariables()`, `interpolateTemplate()`, `generatePrompt()`, `generatePrompts()`.

### `results.ts` — Result Collection [IMPLEMENTED]

Collects agent output JSON files from `.prosecheck/working/outputs/`. Before JSON parsing, `sanitizeAgentOutput()` handles common LLM quirks: strips UTF-8 BOM, extracts JSON from markdown fences, truncates trailing text after the last `}`, strips JSON comments and trailing commas, fixes single-quoted strings, and trims whitespace. After parsing, `normalizeResult()` (from `normalize-result.ts`) fixes common AI field-level mistakes: status synonym mapping (`"passed"` → `"pass"`, `"FAIL"` → `"fail"`), field name aliases (`ruleId` → `rule`, `violations` → `comments`, `title` → `headline`), type coercions (string line numbers to int, single comment objects wrapped in arrays, string arrays to message objects), missing field injection from context (`rule` and `source` from the output filename and rule config), path normalization (backslashes to forward slashes, absolute prefix stripping), and semantic fixes (empty comments on warn downgrades to pass, headline synthesized from first comment). Each file is then validated against `RuleResultSchema` (Zod) — malformed agent output produces clear error messages (including input preview and rule ID) rather than downstream crashes. Successfully parsed results are written back to disk as normalized JSON so external tools see a consistent shape. Detects dropped rules (missing output files). Determines overall run status from worst individual status: fail > dropped > warn > pass. Malformed outputs are treated as fail severity. Key functions: `sanitizeAgentOutput()`, `parseResultFile()`, `collectResults()`, `computeOverallStatus()`.

### `normalize-result.ts` — Output Normalization [IMPLEMENTED]

Normalizes raw parsed AI output into the canonical result schema shape. Runs after `JSON.parse` but before Zod validation. Applies mechanical fixes for common AI mistakes: field name alias resolution (e.g. `ruleId` → `rule`, `violations` → `comments`, `lineNumber` → `line`), status synonym mapping, type coercions (string-to-int line numbers, single-object-to-array wrapping), missing field injection from context, path normalization, and semantic corrections. Key function: `normalizeResult()`.

### `orchestration-prompt.ts` — Shared Orchestration Prompt [IMPLEMENTED]

Generates the orchestration prompt used by both user-prompt and claude-code single-instance modes. Two variants controlled by `agentTeams`:
- **Agent teams mode** (`agentTeams: true`): Instructs the agent to act as an "orchestrator" and launch agent teams (sub-agents) for each rule. Compact format listing rule name and prompt file path.
- **Sequential mode** (`agentTeams: false`): Instructs the agent to process all rules itself with detailed instructions including output paths and step-by-step guidance.

Both variants list rules by human-readable name with relative prompt file paths. Key function: `buildOrchestrationPrompt()`.

### `timing.ts` — Per-Rule Timing Tracker [IMPLEMENTED]

Tracks per-rule elapsed time by watching `.prosecheck/working/timing/` for `<rule-id>.started` markers and `.prosecheck/working/outputs/<rule-id>.json` for completion. `TimingTracker` exposes `markStart(ruleId)` (called programmatically for one-to-one invocations) and `getTiming(ruleId)` returning `{ startedAt, completedAt, durationMs }`. The engine starts the tracker before mode dispatch and stops it after collection; resulting timings are attached to `CollectResultsOutput.timing` and consumed by the stylish and json formatters and by drop-diagnostics to distinguish "never started" from "started but timed out".

### `post-run.ts` — Post-Run Tasks [IMPLEMENTED]

Executes shell commands from `config.postRun` array sequentially after results collection. Injects environment variables: `PROSECHECK_STATUS` (overall status), `PROSECHECK_RESULTS_DIR` (absolute path to outputs directory), `PROSECHECK_RESULTS_JSON` (absolute path to results JSON file, when available). Captures stdout, stderr, and exit codes for each command. Key function: `executePostRun()`.

---

## Rule Calculators (`src/lib/calculators/`)

Pluggable modules that discover rules from different sources. Declared in `config.ruleCalculators` array. Interface: `(options) → Rule[]`.

### `index.ts` — Calculator Registry [IMPLEMENTED]

Dispatches to named calculators based on config. Supports `enabled: false` to disable individual calculators. Defaults to running `rules-md` when no calculators are configured. Throws for unknown calculator names.

### `rules-md.ts` — RULES.md Calculator [IMPLEMENTED]

Discovers `RULES.md` files throughout the project tree using `glob`. Supports an `ignore` option for excluding paths. Supports two heading modes auto-detected by `detectHeadingLevel()`: if the first heading is `# Rules`, `##` headings delimit rules (section mode); otherwise `#` headings delimit rules (original mode). Content between headings is the rule description; deeper subheadings are part of the description. Text before the first rule heading is ignored. The file's directory becomes the rule's inclusion scope (empty for root-level files). Each rule may have its own inline YAML frontmatter block (a `---` fenced block immediately after its heading) to set `group` and other fields independently per rule.

### `adr.ts` — ADR Calculator [IMPLEMENTED]

Reads Architecture Decision Records from a configured path (default `docs/adr/`). Only ADRs containing an explicit `## Rules` heading produce prosecheck rules — ADRs without this heading are documentation-only and skipped. If the `## Rules` section contains `### Sub-rule` headings, each becomes a separate rule (like RULES.md but with `###` instead of `#`); text before the first `###` is ignored as preamble. If there are no `###` headings, the entire section is one rule named after the ADR title. Each rule or sub-rule may have its own inline YAML frontmatter block (a `---` fenced block immediately after its heading or at the start of the `## Rules` section) to set `group` and other fields independently. ADR-derived rules apply project-wide (empty inclusions). Gracefully handles missing ADR directory.

---

## Operating Modes (`src/modes/`)

Control how agents are launched. Independent of environment (any mode runs in any environment).

### `user-prompt.ts` — User Prompt Mode [IMPLEMENTED]

Generates an orchestration prompt (via the shared `orchestration-prompt.ts` builder) and prints it for the user to paste into Claude Code or another LLM. Watches `.prosecheck/working/outputs/` via `fs.watch` for result files and resolves when all expected outputs exist. Supports abort signals for early termination with partial results. Key functions: `buildUserPrompt()`, `watchForOutputs()`.

### `claude-code.ts` — Claude Code Headless Mode [IMPLEMENTED]

Builds an execution plan via `buildExecutionPlan()` from `execution-plan.ts`, then executes batches sequentially with invocations within each batch running in parallel. Each invocation spawns a `claude --print` process via `execa` with `--permission-mode acceptEdits`, `--strict-mcp-config`, `--no-session-persistence`, and configurable `--max-turns`, `--allowedTools`, `--tools`, and `--system-prompt`. Clears the `CLAUDECODE` env var so child CLI processes don't reject as nested sessions. Supports verbose mode (`PROSECHECK_VERBOSE`) with `--output-format stream-json --verbose` and inherited stdout/stderr for live streaming. Invocation types:
- **`one-to-one`**: reads the per-rule prompt file, spawns with scoped `Write` permission for that rule's output file.
- **`one-to-many-teams`**: builds an orchestration prompt via `buildAgentTeamsPrompt()`, sets `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1`.
- **`one-to-many-single`**: builds an orchestration prompt via `buildSequentialPrompt()` for sequential rule processing.

Each invocation passes its `model` to `spawnClaude()` as `--model`, with conflict filtering to strip any `--model` from `additionalArgs`. For multi-rule invocations (`one-to-many-teams`, `one-to-many-single`), `watchForEarlyExit()` monitors the outputs directory and kills the Claude process via `AbortSignal` as soon as all expected output files exist and validate against the result schema — avoiding unnecessary post-processing by orchestrator agents. Configured by `claudeToRuleShape`, `maxConcurrentAgents`, `maxTurns`, `allowedTools`, `tools`, `additionalArgs`, `defaultModel`, `teamsOrchestratorModel`, `systemPrompt`, and `signal` (abort). Key functions: `runClaudeCode()`, `spawnClaude()`.

### Claude Agents SDK Mode **[PLANNED]**

Uses `@anthropic-ai/claude-code-sdk` to launch tool-using agents in-process. Same one-agent-per-rule model without external CLI processes. Not yet implemented — no source file exists.

### Internal Loop Mode **[PLANNED]**

Direct Anthropic API calls with a custom agent loop. Most flexible, most code to maintain. Not yet implemented — no source file exists.

---

## Formatters (`src/formatters/`)

Transform collected results into output. Selected via `--format` flag.

### `stylish.ts` — Human-Readable Output [IMPLEMENTED]

Default formatter. Terminal output with colors (via picocolors). Shows rule name, status (PASS/WARN/FAIL/DROP/ERR), headline, and per-comment file/line details. Includes a summary line with counts per status category. Key function: `formatStylish()`.

### `json.ts` — JSON Output [IMPLEMENTED]

Structured JSON for scripting and machine consumption. Includes overall status, results array, dropped rules, and errors. Key function: `formatJson()`.

### `sarif.ts` — SARIF Output [IMPLEMENTED]

SARIF 2.1.0 schema for GitHub Code Scanning. Maps warn/fail results to SARIF results with physical locations (file + line). Pass results are omitted. Dropped rules are included as error-level findings. Key function: `formatSarif()`.

---

## UI Components (`src/ui/`) [IMPLEMENTED]

Ink + React components for interactive terminal display. Lazy-loaded via dynamic `import()` to avoid loading Ink/React for non-interactive code paths (CI, piped output, JSON/SARIF format).

### `components/LintProgress.tsx` — Live Progress Table [IMPLEMENTED]

Renders a live table showing each rule's name, run status (`waiting` / `running` / `cached` / `done`), and result as agents complete. Each row displays a colored status label (WAIT/`..`/CACHED/PASS/WARN/FAIL/DROP) with the rule name and, when done, the result headline or pass comment. Cached rules render immediately with the CACHED label and a "(cache hit)" note, indicating the rule was skipped because its per-rule cache entry is current. Accepts a `RuleProgressEntry[]` prop. Supports rerendering with updated status for real-time progress tracking.

### `components/Summary.tsx` — Results Summary [IMPLEMENTED]

Final results summary component. Displays total rule count, per-status counts (passed/warned/failed/dropped/cached/errors), and overall status (PASS/WARN/FAIL/DROPPED) with color coding. Cached rules are counted separately so users can see how many rules were skipped via per-rule cache. Accepts a `CollectResultsOutput` prop from the results collector.

### `LintApp.tsx` — Top-Level App [IMPLEMENTED]

Composes `LintProgress` and `Summary` into a single Ink app. Manages `RuleProgressEntry[]` state via a React hook, accepting `ProgressEvent` updates from the engine. Exposes a module-level `getProgressHandler()` for the render wrapper to push events imperatively. Shows `Summary` only when `finalResults` prop is provided.

### `render.ts` — Ink Render Wrapper [IMPLEMENTED]

Manages the Ink render lifecycle. `shouldUseInteractiveUI(format)` checks for TTY + stylish format. `startInteractiveUI()` renders `LintApp`, returns an `InteractiveUI` interface with `onProgress` (feed to engine), `finish(results)` (show summary + unmount), and `cleanup()` (unmount on error).

### `output-watcher.ts` (`src/lib/`) — Live Output Watcher [IMPLEMENTED]

Watches `.prosecheck/working/outputs/` via `fs.watch` for new result files during mode dispatch. When a file matching an expected rule ID appears, reads and validates it via `parseResultFile()`, then fires the `onResult` callback. Deduplicates by rule ID (each rule fires at most once). Returns a stop function. Lazy-imported by the engine only when `onProgress` is set.

---

## Agent Output Format

Agents write structured JSON to `.prosecheck/working/outputs/<rule-id>.json`:

| Status | Written by | Fields |
|---|---|---|
| `pass` | Agent | `status`, `rule`, `source`, optional `comment` |
| `warn` | Agent | `status`, `rule`, `source`, `headline`, `comments[]` |
| `fail` | Agent | `status`, `rule`, `source`, `headline`, `comments[]` |
| `dropped` | Tool | Assigned when no output file received |
| `cached` | Tool | Assigned when the rule's per-rule cache entry is current (fingerprint + all in-scope file hashes match); reported alongside results, no agent was launched |

Each `comments[]` entry has: `message` (required), `file` (optional), `line` (optional).

## File System Layout (Runtime)

```
.prosecheck/
├── config.json              # Base config (committed)
├── config.local.json        # Personal overrides (gitignored)
├── prompt.md                # (optional) Global system prompt
├── prompt-template.md       # (optional) Custom prompt template
├── last-user-run            # JSON: per-rule cache entries { rules: { <id>: { files, fingerprint, status: 'pass' } } }
└── working/                 # Ephemeral workspace (gitignored)
    ├── prompts/             # Generated per-rule prompts (<rule-id>.md)
    ├── outputs/             # Agent result files (<rule-id>.json)
    ├── timing/              # Per-rule start markers (<rule-id>.started)
    └── logs/                # Per-agent stdout/stderr (only when --debug is set)
```

`.prosecheck/working` is wiped at the start of each run. Prompts and outputs are retained after the run for debugging.

## Key Architectural Decisions

See `docs/adr/` for full records:

1. **Plain-text rules evaluated by LLM** — no DSL, natural language
2. ~~One agent per rule~~ — superceded by ADR-012
3. **Change detection selects rules, agents see full codebase** — diffs control what runs, not what agents see
4. **Environment vs operating mode separation** — orthogonal config and execution axes
5. **Pluggable rule calculators** — extensible rule discovery
6. **Gitignore-format for scope patterns** — familiar pattern syntax
7. **RULES.md heading-based format** — headings as rule names
8. **TypeScript/ESM strict stack** — strict TS, ESM-only, modern tooling
9. **Configuration model and runtime defaults** — layered config, ESLint-style exit codes
10. **Zod-defined config schema** — single declaration for types, validation, defaults, and editor introspection
11. **acceptEdits permission mode** — uses `--permission-mode acceptEdits` for Claude CLI because scoped `Write()` permissions are buggy upstream
12. **Flexible rule dispatch** — configurable `claudeToRuleShape` (one-to-one, one-to-many-teams, one-to-many-single) with rule groups and concurrency limits; supercedes ADR-002
13. **Content-based file hashing** — SHA-256 content hashes replace git commit hashes for change detection, fixing circular dependency in CI; enables lightweight `--hash-check` mode
14. **Per-rule last-run cache** — `.prosecheck/last-user-run` stores per-rule entries (file hashes + fingerprint + pass status). A rule is cached only when its fingerprint and every in-scope file hash match; otherwise it re-runs. Fingerprint includes rule text, inclusions, model, frontmatter, prompt template, and global prompt.

## Technology Stack

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| Language | TypeScript (strict + extra flags) |
| Runtime | Node.js >= 20, ESM-only |
| Build | tsup (esbuild wrapper) |
| Test | vitest + msw + ink-testing-library |
| CLI | commander + @commander-js/extra-typings |
| Terminal UI | ink + react + picocolors + yocto-spinner |
| Schema & validation | zod (config types, validation, introspection) |
| Pattern matching | ignore (gitignore format) |
| YAML parsing | yaml (frontmatter extraction) |
| Process management | execa |
| Lint | eslint (strictTypeChecked) + prettier |
